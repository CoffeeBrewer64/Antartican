# Antartican

The fictional language of Antartican. **This is not the actual language of Antartica. It's an inside joke.**

There are two writing and speaking systems (just called "Systems"). These are Strid and Nipok.

Strid uses English letters and sounds.

Nipok uses English letters with apostrophes (') after them with different sounds.
